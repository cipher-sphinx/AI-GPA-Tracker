NWSAPI is the development progress of [NWMATCHER](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher) aiming at [Selectors Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/) conformance. It has been completely reworked to be easily extended and maintained. It is a right-to-left selector parser and compiler written in pure Javascript with no external dependencies. It was initially thought as a cross browser library to improve event delegation and web page scraping in various frameworks but it has become a popular replacement of the native CSS selection and matching functionality in newer browsers and headless environments.

It uses [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to parse CSS selector strings and [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) to transforms these selector strings into Javascript function resolvers. This process is executed only once for each selector string allowing memoization of the function resolvers and achieving unmatched performances.

## Installation

To include NWSAPI in a standard web page:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="nwsapi.js"></script>
```

To include NWSAPI in a standard web page and automatically replace the native QSA:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="nwsapi.js" onload="NW.Dom.install()"></script>
```

To use NWSAPI with Node.js:

```
$ npm install nwsapi
```

NWSAPI currently supports browsers (as a global, `NW.Dom`) and headless environments (as a CommonJS module).

## API

### DOM Selection

#### `ancestor( selector, context, callback )`

Returns a reference to the nearest ancestor element matching `selector`, starting at `context`. Returns `null` if no element is found. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.

#### `first( selector, context, callback )`

Returns a reference to the first element matching `selector`, starting at `context`. Returns `null` if no element matches. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.

#### `match( selector, element, callback )`

Returns `true` if `element` matches `selector`, starting at `context`; returns `false` otherwise. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for the matched element.

#### `select( selector, context, callback )`

Returns an array of all the elements matching `selector`, starting at `context`; returns empty `Array` otherwise. If `callback` is provided, it is invoked for each matching element.


### DOM Helpers

#### `byId( id, from )`

Returns a reference to the first element with ID `id`, optionally fi
